<fix>
--> mouse cursor does not appear when the working page is not the first one

--> completly nuts in PDS when using strings (sometimes in qb45 too)

--> num/caps/scroll lights screwed up after shutting down

... bugs only reported in my crappy box:

--> timer mod when in pure dos isn't restoring the PIT mode/rate as expected
    by BIOS; the DOS/BIOS time gets locked

--> when allocating only one MEM DC, the dos box, where the prog was running, 
    simply closes after the program finish, w/out reporting anything or going 
    back to prompt
</fix>


<add>
--> another filler selection for polyF (calling ul$FillSel for smalle
    scanlines (ie: for uvf rendering) all the time is too expensive)

--> bitmapped font routines...

--> Fill, Flood, 
    Cardinal or Interpolating B-spline (n ctrl points, passing through all
                                        points, no polynomial)

--> TGA/PCX/GIF loaders

--> usTimer

--> dithered versions of the n- to 8-, 15-, 16- and 32-bit conversion procs


--> fill modes (alpha blend, bit patterns, tiles (bitmap), xor, gradient??)
    for all filled gfx routines (rectf, hline, circlef, polyF...)
