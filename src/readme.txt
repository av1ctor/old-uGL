    What you need to know
------------------------------------------

    You are free to change and use the source as you long as you give
    credit where credit due. Now, this is what you need for messing with
    the source. To edit the source, i'd highly recomend you to get visual
    slickedit ( www.slickedit.com ). Without it we wouldn't have been able
    to keep track of anything after the first 2000-3000 lines of code. The
    Visual Slickedit workspace is at src\ugl.vpw. Then you need to change
    mk4???.bat files that are under the src dir. In them you need to set
    your qlb path. Hmm, i think that's about it. All the other stuff you
    need is under src_utils.
