                                SBDRV manual 1.03
    
    
    
        SBDRV stands for Soundblaster driver, it's a low level driver for real mode
        dos which is meant to be a hardware abstraction layer for creative sound 
        blaster series and compatible cards.
        
        The goal was to offer a very simple interface to the user consisting of no 
        more then 5-6 routines. It has been hell finding good information on sound
        blaster programming. It seems as if it never was very well documented. And
        each card is quite different from it's predecessor, so it hasn't always been
        the simplest thing getting it to work. I was ready to give up on it, and 
        started looking for a similar drivers made by other people. What i found was
        VBE/AI which has no documentation at all (yepp, way to go guys), and creatives
        ct-voice driver. But neither of them was anything like i had in mind.
        
        This lib is meant to be used together with UGLs mixer, thus it uses ugls 
        memAlloc. If you want to use it standalone, just change memAlloc and memFree
        to what ever you like and recompile it.
        
        Check version history to see which cards are supported.

====================================
 1.0 - Version history
====================================

    April 2003, version 1.03
        - Added SB 1.0+ support

    April 2003, version 1.02
        - Added the ability to change the dma buffer size,
          see <a href="#3.3">sbdrv_setdmasize()</a>
          
    April 2003, version 1.01
        - Replaced the little floating point compares it had
          with integer for the sake of compability with 486 SX
          and earlier cpus without fpu.
        - Tested on SB Pro and Crystal Pro (SB Pro compatible) 
        - Swtiched to watcom, why? I dunno, borland 5 is just as
          buggy and doesn't generate as good code.
        
    April 2003, version 1.00
        - Added support for sb 2.0, sb 2.0+ and sb pro
        - Tested on windows xp's legalcy emu, and vdm sound
          
          
    April 2003, version 0.03
        - Sound blaster 16 and compatible support
        - Tested on sb live, sb 16, sb pci, connectix virtual pc
          and VDM Sound all ( dsp 4.xx )

====================================
 2.1 - Programming for compability
====================================

    Not allot is required to code compatible applications using this.
    But there are a few things you have to keep in mind. 
    
    - Never assume what the card supports, always check the reported
      capabilities.
            
    That's all :P
    
<a name="2.2"></a>    
====================================
 2.2 - Five steps to playback
====================================

    1. Init the soundblaster and the lib with <a href="#3.1">sbdrv_init</a>
    
    2. Set <a href="#3.5">the callback</a> routine
    
    3. Check <a href="#3.4">sb capabilities</a> to see if the requested mode is 
       available.
       
    4. Start playback with <a href="#3.6">sbdrv_playback_start</a>, once you call it
       the callback with a pointer to a buffer to fill with sound data
       whenever it's needed. This will continue until you call
       sbdrv_playback_stop
       
    5. Stop playback with <a href="#3.7">sbdrv_playback_stop</a>

    That's it.

======================================================
   3.1 - sbdrv_init
======================================================

    Prototype:    
        bool BDECL sbdrv_init ( uint16 base, uint16 irq, uint16 ldma,
                                uint16 hdma )

    Arguments:
        [in]  base              - sb base adress
              irq               - sb irq
              ldma              - 8 bit dma channel
              hdma              - 16 bit dma channel        

    Returns:    
        true for succses and false for error.
        
    Description:
        Inits the soundblaster, if false (0) is passed as the arguments 
        it will try to auto detect the card. However, this only works on
        sb16 compatibles.
        
        Call this before anything else!

    Example:
        sbdrvexs.c
        
<a name="3.2"></a>
======================================================
   3.2 - sbdrv_end
======================================================

    Prototype:    
        void BDECL sbdrv_end ( void )

    Arguments:
        None

    Returns:    
        Nothing
        
    Description:
        Deinits the soundblaster and the lib.

    Example:
        sbdrvexs.c

        
<a name="3.3"></a>
======================================================
   3.3 - sbdrv_setdmasize
======================================================

    Prototype:    
        void BDECL sbdrv_setdmasize ( uint16 size )

    Arguments:
        [in]  size              - The dma buffer size

    Returns:    
        Nothing
        
    Description:
        Sets the DMA buffer size, has to be a multiple
        of two. Remember that only half the buffer is used
        at a time. So if you want it to playback 4kb before
        the callback getting called again, the dma buffer size
        has to be 8 kb.
        
        Call it before calling sbdrv_init!!!!!!                                                      

    Example:

        [out] caps              - The capabilites of the card

    Returns:    
        Nothing
        
    Description:
        Returns the soundblaster capabilities.
        
        caps.dspver                                 = dsp version
        caps.[mono/stereo].[bits8/bits16].available = mode is available
        caps.[mono/stereo].[bits8/bits16].sign      = [sign_false] unsigned sound data
                                                      [sign_true ] signed sound data
                                                      [sign_choice ] selectable
        caps.[mono/stereo].[bits8/bits16].minrate   = Minimum sample rate for mode
        caps.[mono/stereo].[bits8/bits16].maxrate   = Maximum sample rate for mode

                                     uint16) )

    Arguments:
        [in]  callback          - far pointer to the callback

    Returns:    
        Nothing
        
    Description:
        The callback is called once all the data in the double buffer
        has been played and the other half needs to be refilled. As 
        arguments, it will pass a far pointer to the buffer to be filled
        and how many bytes the buffer is. You can always assume that the
        size is a power of two. 
        
        
        The buffer data format is
        _______________________________________________________________

            for ( i = 0; i < size; i++ )
                buffer[i] = 0;
        }

    Returns:    
        true for sucsses and false for error
        
    Description:
        Will start play back if the card can handle the requested mode.
        The callback will be called to fill the sound buffer whenver it's
        needed.
